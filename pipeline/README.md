# OpenActs pipeline

The pipeline is a local command-line project. It owns its Python dependencies
and writes source binaries only to the gitignored content-addressed cache.

## Setup

From the repository root:

```sh
make setup
```

## Acquire a source

Create a local request such as `source-cache/requests/ndpa.json`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://publisher.example/act.pdf",
  "provider_name": "Document provider",
  "document_title": "Act title",
  "document_publisher": "Document publisher",
  "source_class": "official_agency_copy"
}
```

Optional fields are `language` (default `eng`), `publication`,
`redistribution`, `location_notes`, and `document_notes`.

Acquisition is a dry-run by default and performs no network access or writes:

```sh
make acquire REQUEST=source-cache/requests/ndpa.json
```

The explicit execution target downloads and validates the source:

```sh
make acquire-execute REQUEST=source-cache/requests/ndpa.json
```

A valid PDF is stored at
`source-cache/sha256/<prefix>/<full-digest>.pdf`. Each executed run writes one
JSON receipt under `source-cache/runs/`; the receipt contains a Source candidate
validated against the canonical schema. Acquisition never edits
`corpus/sources.jsonl`.
